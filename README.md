# SHNU-CS-320

This repository has my 2 projects for this class, showcasing my skills in software testing, automation, and quality assurance. To ensure my code is functional and secure, I used thorough unit tests to validate object attributes and handle invalid inputs, such as null values and duplicate IDs. This approach aligned closely with the software requirements, ensuring constraints and conditions were met, which helped the overall quality and reliability of the software. By interpreting user needs, I translated requirements into detailed test cases that covered a wide range of scenarios and edge cases. My design process involved careful planning, code % checks, and adherence to best practices, such as using assertThrows for exception handling and reusing setup methods to improve test efficiency. These practices, along with commitment to quality, helped me create a maintainable and secure software solution.
